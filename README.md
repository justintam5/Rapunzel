# Rapunzel

A personal project that is meant to involve some sort of pully system to pull groceries and or people up to the second floor of an apartment complex, from the balcony. Will allow the people who live there(myself and one other) to get up into the apartment incase we're locked out, or pull groceries up to the apartment so we don't have to carry them all the way.
